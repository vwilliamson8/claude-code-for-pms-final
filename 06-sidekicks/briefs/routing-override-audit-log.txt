# Routing Override Audit Log

One-pager · Product, Dispatch · 5 March 2026

## Problem
When a handler manually overrides Dispatch's routing — picks someone other than the responder we recommended — there's no record of it anywhere. No who, no when, no why. The support lead's team has hit this more than once: a complaint comes in about a responder who was passed over, and there's no way to even confirm an override happened, let alone why.

## Proposal
Log every manual override: who made it, when, which responder they picked instead of the recommended one, and a short reason if they typed one. Surface it in the console's existing activity view, next to the callout it belongs to.

## Owner
The engineering manager's team builds it. The product designer has already mocked the activity-view addition — it's a small addition to a screen that exists.

## Scope
Overrides only. Not a general audit log for every action in the console — just the one decision that currently leaves no trace.

## Next steps
The engineering manager's team can pick this up once profile redesign wraps. Small, contained, ready to build.
