# Bulk Callout

One-pager · Product, Dispatch · 12 January 2026

## Problem
When something big happens — a building evacuation, a multi-block search, anything that needs more than one responder — a handler right now sends callouts the same way they'd send one: pick a responder, wait, pick the next. Halloran mentioned it too, on the Supply side, when a shift needs several people kitted out at once. For a handler managing more than one responder, or covering for another handler who's out, that's slow exactly when speed matters most.

## Proposal
Let a handler select several responders from the console and send them all the same callout in a single action. Each responder still gets their own accept/decline, on their own phone, same as today — this isn't a group message, it's the existing callout flow sent to more than one person at once.

## Success measure
Fewer support tickets mentioning a handler who "just started calling people directly" during a multi-responder incident. Time-to-full-coverage on a multi-responder callout should drop, though we don't have a clean baseline for it yet — worth getting one before this ships.

## Scope
Only the existing callout flow, sent to more than one responder. No group chat between responders, no bulk requisitions, no change to how any individual responder's callout is scored or ranked. If a table needs to send different jobs to different people, that's still one callout at a time — this is only for "the same job, several people."

## Open questions
Flagging this for whoever picks it up next quarter. Console changes will need the product designer's input on the multi-select interaction, and engineering will need to scope the actual send logic — noting it here so it isn't lost, but nobody's picked it up yet.
